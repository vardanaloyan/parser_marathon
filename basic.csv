This event benefits the MICHAEL J. FOX FOUNDATION (501c non-profit for Parkinson’s Research).
 
Run Responsibly …
Hilton Head Island’s ONLY beer running event – for those runners that want a slightly different challenge to their normal run – or, for those beer lovers that may have a running problem. Whatever motivates you – come out and see how fast you can run 1 MILE and drink 4 BEERS (or, come out and see what someone looks like when running after 4 beers).
RULES to get in the game
1. You MUST be 21 years or older to participate.
2. You MUST provide for and name a designated driver that is responsible for transporting you after the event.

2. Beer must be consumed before the lap has begun, within the transition area.  (The 10 meter zone before the start/finish line.)
3. The race begins with the drinking of the first beer in the last meter of the transition zone.  This ensures the competitors run a complete mile.

5. No specialized cans or bottles may be used that give an advantage by allowing the beer to pour at a faster rate.  “Super mega mouth cans” or “vortex bottles” and other such containers are prohibited.
